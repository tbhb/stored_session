# Stored Session Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security bugs seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please email `security[at]tonyburns[dot]net` with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create it, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue. If possible, please encrypt your email using my GPG key, which is available at <https://github.com/tbhb.gpg>. I will make every effort to respond within 48 hours.

Please **DO NOT** open public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions for security vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Policy

When I receive a security bug report, I will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
4. Release new versions and notify users.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or email me at the address above.
